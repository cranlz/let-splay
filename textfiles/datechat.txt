01 So, like, me and (A) are in this huge fight right now because (B) and (C) told me she lied to me about going to the game the other night.
02 I think my favorite flavor of ice cream is (A). No, on second thought, it's definitely (B).
03 Ugh I really don't want to write this paper for lit class. We have to write (A) pages! That's so many!
04 Do you think (A) would look good on me? I've been thinking about wearing (B), but I'm definitely more of a (C). 
05 I cannot believe (A), (B), and (C) ganged up on me like that. Like, forget (D); (E) is my only real friend.

07 My astrological sign is (A). Let me guess, you're probably (B), right?

09 People often tell me that I would make a good (A). I guess I can see it.
10 LOL, look at this picture of (A) I found! Literally me.
